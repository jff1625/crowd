# crowd

For a while now I've been fascinated by the way crowds of people can cross through each other without any collisions, just by making minor changes in direction and speed, and wondered how complex a solution would be needed to simulate that. This is my attempt to find out.

Checkpoints:
-animation using pixi.js
-collision detection
-collision prediction
-basic evasive manoeuvres

Next: improve collision prediction
